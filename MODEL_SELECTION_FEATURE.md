# Model Selection Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Autocommiter extension now features ergonomic, user-friendly model selection for GitHub Models API. Users are never stressed with manual model configuration.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Model Caching**
- Models are fetched from GitHub Models API once and cached in workspace state
- Subsequent model selections use cached data (no extra network calls)
- Cache is refreshed automatically on each API key usage

### 2. **Intelligent Model Selection Flow**
- **First time**: User is prompted to select a model from available options
- **Subsequent times**: Uses the user's saved preference (if set to persist)
- **Quick override**: Users can always choose "use for this commit only" to skip their saved choice

### 3. **Three-Step Selection UX** (when needed)
1. User triggers commit generation without a saved model
2. Extension shows a quick pick of available models with:
   - Model ID (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
   - Full name (e.g., `GPT-4o Mini (Fast & Cost-effective)`)
   - Status badge (Available/Preview/Experimental)
   - Currently selected indicator
3. After selecting, user chooses:
   - "Use for this commit only" → No persistent change
   - "Save as default" → Saved to settings for future use

### 4. **Smart Defaults**
- Default model: `gpt-4o-mini` (fast, cost-effective)
- Built-in fallback models if API fetch fails:
  - GPT-4o, Llama, Mistral, Cohere models
- Auto-update setting (enabled by default)

### 5. **Zero Configuration (Optional)**
- Users who want to set a model permanently can:
  - Use the UI selection → save as default
  - Or directly edit `autocommiter.selectedModel` in settings
  - Both approaches work seamlessly

## New Extension Settings

### `autocommiter.selectedModel` (string)
- **Default**: `gpt-4o-mini`
- **Description**: Default AI model for commit message generation
- **Examples**: `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct`, `Mistral-large`

### `autocommiter.autoUpdateModels` (boolean)
- **Default**: `true`
- **Description**: Automatically refresh available models from API

## New Module: `modelManager.ts`
Handles all model-related operations:

- `fetchAvailableModels(apiKey)` - Fetches models from GitHub Models API
- `getCachedModels(context)` - Retrieves cached models
- `updateCachedModels(context, models)` - Updates cache
- `getSelectedModelId(context)` - Gets current selection from settings
- `setSelectedModelId(modelId)` - Persists selection to settings
- `showModelSelectionPicker(context, apiKey)` - Interactive UI for selection
- `getModelForApi(context, apiKey)` - Main entry point for getting the model to use

## Modified Components

### `extension.ts` Changes
1. Imports `modelManager`
2. Updated `callInferenceApi()` signature to accept model parameter
3. API fallback flow now:
   - Gets API key
   - Calls `modelManager.getModelForApi()` for intelligent selection
   - Uses selected model for API call
   - Provides clear feedback on which model was used

### `package.json` Changes
- Added configuration section with 4 new settings
- Documented each setting with descriptions and examples

### `README.md` Changes
- Added section on GitHub Models API usage
- Documented model selection workflow
- Added configuration section with all settings
- Explained security and privacy considerations

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: First Time Using API (No Saved Model)
```
User clicks autocommit
  ↓
Copilot unavailable → try API
  ↓
API key prompt (if needed)
  ↓
Model selection quick pick appears
  ↓
User selects model
  ↓
Choose: "One-time" or "Save as default"
  ↓
Message generated and committed
  ↓
Next time: Same model used automatically (if saved)
```

### Scenario 2: API Key Exists, Model Saved
```
User clicks autocommit
  ↓
Copilot unavailable → try API
  ↓
Use saved model automatically
  ↓
Message generated and committed
  ↓
(No prompts, fully automatic)
```

### Scenario 3: User Wants Different Model
```
User goes to VS Code Settings
  ↓
Searches for "Autocommiter"
  ↓
Changes `autocommiter.selectedModel`
  ↓
Next commit uses new model
```

## Ergonomics Improvements

✅ **No stressing users**
- Smart defaults provided
- First-time selection is intuitive
- Once set, works automatically
- Easy to override if needed

✅ **Minimal prompts**
- Only asks for model once
- API key prompt is only once
- Subsequent operations are silent

✅ **No manual API calls needed**
- Models are auto-fetched and cached
- Users don't need to know about API endpoints
- Extension handles everything behind the scenes

✅ **Settings-friendly**
- Can be configured via UI or settings.json
- Clear documentation for each option
- Sensible defaults for all options

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test first-time API setup with model selection
2. Verify model is cached after first fetch
3. Test persisting model selection
4. Test one-time model override
5. Test fallback to default models if API fails
6. Verify settings changes are reflected immediately

## Migration Note

Existing users upgrading to this version:
- Will use `gpt-4o-mini` by default
- On first API usage, will be prompted to confirm/select a model
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
